# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data.
# These should not be part of version control as they are data points
# which are potentially sensitive and subject to change per environment.
# Use a variables file with a different name (e.g., terraform.tfvars.sample)
# to provide a template for others.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
# and so are not checked in

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
